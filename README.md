# Factify
FactiFy (Factual Analysis and Content Truth Identification for You) is a groundbreaking open-source browser extension designed to create a safer, more transparent, and educational digital environment for children and young adults. This repository is the basic backend part of the Factify project. 
Factify is committed to providing a safe and informative space for users. This repository contains a demonstration of a content safety tool we're developing to help us achieve that goal.

## What it Does

This tool retrieves content from a given URL and searches a database for pre-analyzed scores related to potential inappropriateness. Inappropriate content can include, but is not limited to:

    Violence: Content that depicts or glorifies violence against people or animals.
    Hate Speech: Content that attacks a person or group on the basis of attributes such as race, religion, ethnic origin, national origin, sex, disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.   
    Sexually Suggestive Content: Content that is sexually explicit or intended to arouse the user.

## Current Limitations and Future Work

This is a work in progress. While it can identify potentially inappropriate content, it's important to understand its limitations:

    Limited Scope: It currently focuses on predefined categories of inappropriate content.
    Database Reliance: The accuracy of the scores depends on the accuracy of the LLM we use in it.

## We're actively working to improve the tool by adding functionalities like:

    Factification: Identifying and verifying factual claims within the content.
    Claim Checking: Identifying and evaluating the validity of claims made in the content.

These features will help us combat misinformation and disinformation, further enhancing the reliability and safety of Artogenia.

## Getting Started

This repository is currently for demonstration purposes only. We just customized it for medium web site. It requires specific dependencies and database configuration to run. 
Future updates may include instructions for wider use.
